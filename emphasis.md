## Emphasis & Focal Point

### What is Emphasis?
Emphasis is, at it's core, calling attention to something. In 2d design, we use this to draw a viewer through an image, or get them to the important parts. The technical term for creating a point on emphasis in a piece is focal point. Depending on it's purpose and your intent, your design might have multiple focal points, or lesser points of emphasis called accents. Care must be taken when creating multiple points of emphasis in a piece, because the more focal points and accents your piece has, the less power each on has to draw the attention of your viewer. 

Emphasis and focal point are fairly easy concepts to understand, but very challenging to master. The main thing to keep in mind is this, If everything is emphasized, nothing is emphasized.
