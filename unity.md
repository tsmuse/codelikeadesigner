# Code like a designer
## Unity

What makes a design a design and not just a jumble of items on a page? What makes some pages feel more “tight” than others? Unity. 

### What is Unity?

Unity is a feeling of closeness, of cohesion, or being in the right place, among the elements in a design. The jumbled feeling you get when you look at some webpages, maybe even your own, is a lack of Unity in the design. 

#### Visual Unity vs Intellectual Unity

While a group of things may very much be related to each other (e.g. a group of photos from a wedding) they can be arranged in such a way that they still don’t feel like they belong together. This is the difference between Visual Unity and Intellectual Unity. Things that are thematically related at said to be intellectually unified. This kind of connection can aid in creating a unified design, but it isn’t a guarantee. 

Visual Unity is primarily what we’re concerned with here, and even a group of totally unrelated elements can be made to feel like they belong together. An important aspect of Visual Unity is the initial feeling that the whole is seen before the individual elements that make it up. If your first impression is that there is a bunch of things on a page and then you start to group them together, your page is lacking Visual Unity. 

The following techniques are ways to achieve Unity in your designs. 

#### Order vs Chaos
Like most things in design, and life, Unity is a force you must balance carefully against other characteristics of your design. Unity is in direct opposition with Variety, and too much or too little of either can have disastrous results. Too much Unity and a piece will feel mechanical, soulless, and boring. Things that are too unified tend to evoke people’s worst fears about conformity and a loss of individuality. Too much Variety and your piece will feel orderless, chaotic, jumbled, and random. Things with too much variety tend to evoke feelings of carelessness and lawlessness and generally feel “un-designed.” 

The challenge is to create Unity with enough Variety to not feel mechanical and boring, but still feel intentional and harmonious. Depending on what you’re trying to convey, your balance will change. 

### How to achieve Unity

#### Proximity
#### Repetition
#### Continuation
#### Continuity
